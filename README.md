# inMyFridge
Our motivation in building a webapp for users to have better use of the ingredients in their fridge, reduce waste, and  to be able to try out new recipes while with the use of what they already have at home.
## Features
- User can list ingredients that they would like to use and our webapp will generate a list of dishes that they can make with those ingredients.
- A variety of images of dishes will be displayed based on the recipes generated.
- Youtube searches can be made based on the title of the dishes
## How are we different 
With the help of the Spoonacular API the search for recipes will use as many of the given ingredients as possible an require as few additional ingredients as possible.
